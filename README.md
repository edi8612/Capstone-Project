# 🚀 Capstone Project

**Title:** Indoor Localization and Orientation Estimation Using ESP32 and Kalman Filtering
**Author:** Edi Sulo (edi8612)

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project presents an embedded IoT solution for indoor localization and orientation tracking using ESP32 microcontrollers and sensor fusion. The system collects sensor data over Wi‑Fi and applies a Kalman filter implemented in C++ to reduce noise and estimate accurate orientation angles like pitch and roll.

**Key Goals:**

* Real-time orientation estimation using IMU sensors on the ESP32.
* Reliable Wi‑Fi-based communication between ESP32 nodes and a central server.
* Signal smoothing and data fusion using a custom Kalman filter in C++.
* Efficient data streaming and logging for analysis and visualization.

---

## 📦 Features

* 📡 **ESP32 Firmware** – Collects IMU (accelerometer + gyroscope) data and transmits via Wi‑Fi.
* 🧠 **Kalman Filter** – Implements a multi-dimensional Kalman filter for accurate angle tracking.
* 📊 **Orientation Output** – Computes pitch, roll, and yaw in real-time.
* 🛠️ **Logging Support** – Sensor and orientation data saved for further visualization and analysis.

---

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

* **ESP32 (ESP-IDF)** – Microcontroller platform with built-in Wi-Fi
* **C++** – Language used for Kalman filtering and core logic
* **Wi-Fi Communication** – ESP32-to-server data transmission
* **IMU Sensors** – Accelerometer and gyroscope data used for orientation estimation

## 🧑‍💻 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* ESP32 board (e.g., ESP32-WROOM-32)
* IMU sensor (e.g., MPU6050, MPU9250)
* ESP-IDF installed and configured
* A local server for receiving and processing data (e.g., Python, Flask, or Node.js)

### Setup Instructions

#### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/edi8612/Capstone-Project.git
cd Capstone-Project
```

#### 2. Configure ESP32

* Connect the IMU sensor to the ESP32
* Modify the Wi-Fi credentials and pin configuration in `main.cpp` or configuration files

#### 3. Build and Flash Firmware

```bash
idf.py set-target esp32
idf.py menuconfig
idf.py build
idf.py flash monitor
```

#### 4. Start the Data Receiver

* Implement or launch a server (Python/Flask, Node.js, etc.) that listens for data on a specific port.
* Log or visualize data using CSV, JSON, or a front-end dashboard.

## 🧮 Kalman Filter Overview

The Kalman filter implemented here:

* Uses gyroscope for angular rate prediction
* Uses accelerometer for correction (gravity vector)
* Filters out sensor noise and drift
* Outputs accurate pitch and roll angles

## 🧪 Sample Results

> *(Include screenshots or CSV excerpts if available)*

* ✅ Raw vs. Filtered data comparisons
* ✅ Smooth, real-time angle tracking
* ✅ Improved orientation accuracy in dynamic environments

---

## 🧭 Future Improvements

* Add web-based dashboard for real-time plotting
* Fuse magnetometer data for complete yaw estimation
* Develop OTA updates for firmware changes
* Explore MQTT for scalable message passing
